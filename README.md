# Pygame_OOP

Following some exercises from Irv Kalb: Object-Oriented Python. Master OOP by Building Games and GUIs, 2022.

Trying those on my own, but using the templates for the Pygame syntax.

The repository for the book with all the templates and the solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/IrvKalb/Object-Oriented-Python-Code/tree/master/).
